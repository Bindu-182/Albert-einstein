                        <h3>On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first of these four papers is on the photoelectric effect, where electrons are released when light hits a material. Einstein put forth that light consists of "discrete packets" as opposed to the widely accepted wave theory of light. This later advanced the theory of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

                            The second paper focuses on Brownian motion, the erratic random movement of microscopic particles in a fluid as they collide. This paper helped to move the theory of atoms into reality by offering a way for scientists to count and observe their behavior during experiments.
